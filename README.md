# C# Spatial Analysis & GIS Algorithms Toolkit

This is an open-source C# Windows Forms application designed to demonstrate and implement a wide range of fundamental spatial analysis and computational geometry algorithms. It serves as a valuable educational tool and practical resource for students, developers, and researchers in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

The application allows users to visually draw geometric shapes (points, lines, polygons) and perform complex spatial analyses, with the results rendered directly on the canvas.

Some sample files are stored in the data folder, and users can modify them according to their needs.
